# Trident

> Because I had to call it something

Trident is my personal experiment in creating a highly-abstracted web
application framework for use with Datomic Cloud. But it's also just a
collection of libraries, containing anything I happen to abstract out of
projects I'm working on.

My top-level goal with Trident is to maximize code reuse (especially my own, but
hopefully for others as well). This has two parts:

 - There should be high-level interfaces that give you lots of leverage (like
   frameworks).

 - When the high-level interfaces don't cut it, it should be easy to use only
   the parts you want, customizing behavior as needed (like libraries).

See [this article](https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/grow/) for more
information about my philosophy.

## Contents

I keep the code in a single `src` dir, but I provide multiple artifacts. Any
code in `src/trident/<foo>` is available in the `trident/<foo>` artifact. For
example, `{trident/cli {:mvn/version "<version>"}}` will give you access to the
`trident.cli` namespace. All artifacts use the same version.

I use the `trident/docs` artifact for [documentation on cljdoc]. You can
[browse the namespaces](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident)
to see what's available, but here's a list of the artifacts for convenience:

 - [`trident/repl`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.repl). A handful of convenience functions for use at the repl.
 - [`trident/util`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.util). A collection of utility functions & macros.
 - [`trident/cli`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.cli) (includes `util`). Makes it easy to define and reuse CLIs for tools.deps-based build tasks.
 - [`trident/ion-dev`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.ion-dev) (includes `cli`). Stuff for ion develeopment
 - [`trident/build`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.build) (includes `util`, `cli`). A collection of build tasks made with `trident/cli`.
 - [`trident/datomic`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.datomic) (includes `util`). Janky file-based persistence for Datomic Free.
 - [`trident/datomic-cloud`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.datomic-cloud) (includes `util`). Tools for Datomic Cloud.
 - [`trident/ring`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.ring). Some Ring middleware.
 - [`trident/firebase`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.firebase). Functions for authenticating Firebase user tokens.
 - [`trident/ion`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.ion) (includes `util`). Utilities for working with Datomic Ions
 - [`trident/web`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.web) (includes `util`, `datomic-cloud`, `firebase`, `ion`, `ring`). Highly contrived web framework.
 - [`trident/datascript`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.datascript) (includes `util`). Frontend tools for syncing Datascript with Datomic.
 - [`trident/views`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.views) (includes `util`). Some Reagent components and stuff.
 - [`trident/cljs-http`](https://cljdoc.org/d/trident/docs/CURRENT/api/trident.cljs-http). Slight additions to `cljs-http`
 - `trident/frontend` (includes `util`, `datascript`, `views`, `cljs-http`). Just a bundle of other artifacts.

Also see [`trident.cli` Getting Started](doc/cli.md).

## Progress

While I hope Trident will be useful for others, I'm primarily focusing on my own
use cases because 1) there are things I want to build, 2) developing Trident as
I build real things will help to make sure it's actually useful. With that out
of the way, if you're interested in anything Trident does, I'd love to chat.

Projects using Trident:

 - [FlexBudget](https://github.com/jacobobryant/flexbudget), a [flexible budgeting app](https://notjust.us).
